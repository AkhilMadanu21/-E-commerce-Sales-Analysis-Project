![72688282-increasing-graph-and-sales-word-on-blueprint-background](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3390e08d-a094-4604-9c19-74e8962ccdf8)

I recently completed a project that analyzes e-commerce sales data using SQL for backend analysis and Power BI for interactive dashboards. This project helped me explore critical sales metrics and trends that can drive better decision-making for online retailers.
## Overview

This project focuses on deriving valuable business insights from an e-commerce dataset using MySQL. It demonstrates the use of SQL for data exploration, analysis, and reporting, and covers customer behavior, product performance, revenue trends, and operational metrics.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The database includes the following key tables:
- ecom_orders ‚Äì Stores order-level data including quantity, total amount, order status, date, payment method, and customer ID.
- ecom_products ‚Äì Contains product details like name, category, and product ID.
- ecom_customers ‚Äì Includes customer information such as ID and name.


## Project structure 
- **Database Setup**: Creation of the `E-commerce sales` database.
- **Importing data**: Importing sample csv file into tables.
- **Business Problems**: Solving 12 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE `E-commerce sales`;
``` 

## Data Import

- Top customer contributes [Y amount] to the revenue.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how structured query language (SQL) can be effectively used to extract actionable insights from e-commerce transactional data. Through various analytical queries, we were able to:

- Identify top-performing product categories and high-revenue-generating products.
- Understand customer behavior by analyzing repeat purchases and average order quantities.
- Detect operational inefficiencies by evaluating return and cancellation rates.
- Uncover key trends in revenue growth across months and purchasing patterns.
- Provide valuable inputs for marketing, sales, and supply chain decision-making.

By answering real-world business questions with data, this project highlights the importance of data-driven strategies in improving customer satisfaction, optimizing inventory, and maximizing revenue in an e-commerce environment.
